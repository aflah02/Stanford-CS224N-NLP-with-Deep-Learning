Takeaways to remember:
- Log to convert product to sum (Remember DJ Jatin Dijkstra Question from ADA)
- 1/T to get avg
- -ve sign added as we like to minimize objective else +ve sign also worked if we maximized

2 Vectors:
- One when centre
- One when Context

Last equation gives the probability

- Dot product measure of similarity
- u<sub>o</sub> context words
- v<sub>c</sub> centre word
- Exponential pushes the bigger numbers to be more bigger in some dimensions

Now we wanna fiddle these word vectors to maximize the probabilities

- Each row has `d` values
- 2 Vectors per word u and v
